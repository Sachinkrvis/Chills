Android based Music app

Steps need to run the project:

step-1: for running the project on your local enviroment you have to create the new project and copy the code of src.
step-2: the code you have to allow for READ_MEDIA_AUDIO 
step-3: implement the  recycler view , card view in a build gradle (module: app)

it is a very basic music app so feel free to add any features in it..
